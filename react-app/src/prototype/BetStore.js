/*

Let's take all bets that we have, and show them in the display, organized by token, then by game.

Once bets are locally in our client, we watch blockchain for updates.

Button: "Remove bets that arenâ€™t mine"

Button: "Pull" bets from server

In the "New game", they will have a checkbox, and you can select multi. Every combination you try, it will try and execute it locally
and estimate gas, and show you winnings, etc.

For now UI allows only simple matches, one outcome per bet. But contract supports more complex bets, of course.

We watch all Transfer/Approval events *from now onwards*, to keep UI up to date.

We watch all Contract events (games, tickets, etc.) without missing a beat, because we need to build state from logs!
